## About the Project

### Description
Open Library Explorer is an interactive data visualization platform that leverages the Open Library API to compare books, authors, and genres. Designed for bibliophiles, researchers, and casual readers, it offers:

- **Trend Analysis**: Publishing trends via line/stacked charts
- **Comparative Tools**: Side-by-side author/book comparisons
- **Timeline Explorer**: Popular books by genre/year

## Documentation

### Technical Description
Application Purpose: Open Library Explorer is a React-based data visualization application that helps users explore and compare book data from the Open Library API. It provides insights into publishing trends, author comparisons, and genre popularity over time.

#### Key Features
- Interactive charts (Line, Bar) showing publishing trends
- Book and author comparison tools
- Timeline explorer for genre/year analysis
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

#### API Used: Open Library API (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
- Provides access to book metadata, author information, and cover images
- Rate-limited public API with JSON responses

#### Visualization Types:
- Line charts for trend analysis over time
- Bar charts for comparison views
- Stacked charts for genre distribution

#### Limitations:
- API has rate limits (unauthenticated requests limited)
- Data completeness depends on Open Library's coverage
- Mobile responsiveness still in development

  <p><em>Entity Relationship Diagram for the Library System</em></p>
</div>
This diagram represents the frontend data model derived from the Open Library API responses. Books are central entities connected to authors, genres, and publication years. The application maintains this structure in its state management.

### Use Case Diagram

```mermaid
%% Library System Use Case Diagram
useCaseDiagram
    actor User as "Library User"
    
    rectangle "Library Analytics System" {
        (View Publishing Trends) as trend
        (Compare Authors/Books) as compare
        (Explore by Genre/Year) as explore
        (Search Book Metadata) as search
        (Toggle Chart Types) as toggle
        (Filter Data) as filter

        User --> trend
        User --> compare
        User --> explore
        User --> search

        trend ..> toggle : extends
        explore ..> filter : extends
    }
```
<p><em>How users interact with Open Library Explorer's visualization features</em></p>
</div>
#### Key Features:
- View Book Trends: Access line charts showing publishing trends
- Compare Authors: Side-by-side visualization of author productivity
- Explore by Genre: Filter books by genre and publication year
- Search Books: Find specific books by title/author

### Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
<img src="https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/documentation/DFD.png?raw=true">
#### Data Flow Process:
1. User interacts with UI components (filters, buttons)
2. Application checks for cached API responses
3. If no cache, fetches fresh data from Open Library API
4. Transforms raw API data into chart-compatible formats
5. Updates React state with processed data
6. Re-renders Chart.js visualizations
6. Displays updated charts to user

## Concept Process
### Ideation
- **Goal:** Simplify complex literary data into digestible visuals.

- **Colour Palette:**

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary Colour 1 | ![#Primary1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d6131f-42e8-424f-8f82-f733decb1b45) <em>#C19A84</em> |
| Primary Colour 2 | ![Primary2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4c413d8-b04e-41b6-beb8-02ce304ea4b3) <em>#51352C</em> |
| Secondary Colour | ![Secondary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9fb6174-6d8d-4948-9446-658e9526c6fe) <em>#4bc089</em> | 
| Accent Colour | ![Accent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f406d3b3-249b-4f88-aaad-6e13c9acb027) <em>#fff</em> |

- **Typography:** Serif fonts (e.g., Georgia) for readability and matching the theme.
